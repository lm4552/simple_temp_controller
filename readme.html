<h1 id="simple-temperature-controller">Simple Temperature Controller</h1>
<p>This is a simple project to control some outputs by the value of a temperature sensor with MircoPython on a Raspberry Pi Pico. In normal operation the actual temperature of the temperature sensor is shown on the two 7-segment displays. Additionally, the current state (e.g. currently cooling or not) is shown using three LEDs. The threshold value for the desired temperature can be set with two push buttons.</p>
<p>The python code is used for controlling a refrigerator as well as a simple aquarium cooler and you can find the code for both on the GitHub repository.</p>

<h2 id="refrigerator-controller">Refrigerator Controller</h2>
<p>I used this project to control an old refrigerator which did not properly cool anymore. However, the refigerator had a manual button for activating the cooling which still worked. So I simply interfaced this button and put a temperature sensor inside the fridge. For interfacing the button I had to use some MOSFET modules because I did not have other components available.</p>
